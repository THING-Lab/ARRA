# Kinect Scan
Equipment: Kinect v1
Software : Skanect pro, Kinect SDK driver

## Walk Through
1. Make sure Kinect is properly plugged into a power cable and USB port and is detectable.
2. Open Skanect Pro. If the kinect is detectable, it should show up on the right as the scanning device.
3. In “New” select “Room”
4. Put in the correct dimension of the room size. Click start.
5. Position yourself in the middle of the room you would like to scan.
6. Press record. And once the timer is off, slowly move around the room to scan.
7. Once you have finished scanning, select Stop.
8. The scan will finalize in time, and once done move on to the “process” tab and select “Colorize” and “Run” to texturize the scanned mesh.
9. Once it is done colorizing, move on to the “Share” tab, and select “Export Model” 
10. Select settings “Format” as “Obj”, and “Colors” as “Texture UV”. This will reduce the faces, but that is okay. Select “Export” to save in the pathway and name as you choose.
11. Import it into Unity by dragging and dropping into the scene.
