# ARRA: Augmented Reality Remote Assistance
The Augmented Reality Remote Assistance (ARRA) project investigates the combination of virtual and augmented reality to support communication between two distant parties, for example, a repair expert guiding a less experienced technician in the field.  To illustrate this scenario we’ve prepared a five-minute video showing ARRA’s features as well as a one-minute “teaser” video.

The project is a collaboration between the ACME Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder’s ATLAS Institute and Ericsson Research in Santa Clara, California.

The following provides information on the project repository and documentation for the ARRA project, which is a set of companion AR and VR applications that enable immersive communication between two distant parties. [This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B6aqpBO0N1dppQSJGqj_WXARENiIOI8r8_WxDKFvpic/edit#slide=id.p1) provides an overview of the project.


## Applications
ARRA comprises two distinct applications, a Virtual Reality application that runs on an Oculus Rift headset and an Augmented Reality application that runs on a Microsoft Hololens. We refer to these as the: 
- [VR Expert Application](./VR-Expert-App): Enables a user to immerse themselves in the environment of the technician they are assisting.
- [AR Technician Application](./Hololens-Novice-App/Readme.md#ar-technician-application): Enables a Technician to scan their environment and share it with an expert.


## Setup
- Download or Clone this project repository.
- Install [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
- Follow the separate setup instructions for each application: [Expert](./VR-Expert-App), [Technician](./Hololens-Novice-App/Readme.md#ar-technician-application)


## Acknowledgments
ARRA was first developed at the [ATLAS Institute](atlas.colorado.edu) of the University of Colorado Boulder in collaboration with Ericsson Research.
